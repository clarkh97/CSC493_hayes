# *Power Tester*
## Description/Motivation

My project is intended to measure the power of a device consumed while charging, and differentiating between trickle charging to maintain level and charging at normal speed. The goal of keeping track of such metrics is to calculate how much power is consumed while a device is plugged into a charger, but already at full capacity.

### Prerequisites

This program will run on a Raspberry Pi using a current sensor hat. Anyone intending to use the software will need a Raspberry Pi along with a current sensor hat as well as a chargin cable that has been cut in two in order to get the voltage and current readings through the cable.

## Built With

- Python 3
- Raspberry Pi OS
